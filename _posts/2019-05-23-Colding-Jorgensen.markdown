## Abstract

Energy conversion devices such as Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOECs) and Fuel Cells (SOFCs) give an opportunity to exploit fluctuating energy, e.g. harvest over-production periods from wind or solar energy, and use the energy in under-production periods.<br/>

For the SOFCs and SOECs to be efficient, they must have high ionic conductivity [1]. Recent studies show that doping has preferential grain boundary planes. The grain boundary plane distribution will therefore highly affect the conductivity of the material [2]. The conductivity will furthermore be affected by cracks, nano-structural defects or changes.<br/>

We show how 3D Orientation Mapping in Transmission Electron Microscopy (3D-OMiTEM) is a promising technique for nondestructive visualization of these materials in 3D with a resolution of down to a few nm [3]. 3D-OMiTEM utilizes dark-field conical scanning in combination with sample tilts to obtain combined reciprocal and direct space information.  The conical scanning uses beam tilt to choose diffraction rings from which dark field images are formed. Therefore, the reciprocal information is given by the beam tilt and sample rotation. Each measurement thus constitutes a 2D-projection of the 3D grain shapes observed for a point in the reciprocal space. The subsequent reconstruction procedure provides orientation determination locally in the interior of the sample. Typically, each of the 6-10 inner rings in the diffraction pattern is used for every sample rotation angle. The result is up to 100,000 images that are reconstructed into a 3D grain orientation map. We show, that the technique can be used on 150 nm thick samples with a sample tilt range of [-72:72] and 2° step.<br/>

We apply the 3D-OMiTEM method on state-of-the-art material for SOFCs, namely Gadolinium doped Ceria (CGO). The electrospun cubic CGO nanofibers calcined at 800°C, and with an average diameter of 150 nm, were chosen since they have constant thickness when rotated. The presentation will describe the 3D-OMiTEM method and give an overview of studies of CGO including grain boundary plane distribution together with a comparison between conventional STEM-tomography and 3D-OMiTEM.<br/>
