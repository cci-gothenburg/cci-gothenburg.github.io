## Abstract

Bacterial biofilms can be beneficial in environmental technologies and bioprocesses. A better understanding of the biofilm formation by bacteria and their interaction with biotic and abiotic surfaces is necessary to develop appropriate materials and technologies to facilitate their formation. In marine environments, especially in fish production, transmission of pathogenic bacteria can be inhibited by introducing probiotic bacteria forming biofilms. Thus, the use of electron microscopy is a key for exploring the enhancement and promotion of biofilm by marine bacteria.<br/>

The present study is focused on marine bacteria, such as, the fish probiotic bacterium Phaeobacter inhibens (DSM 17395), which produces a probiotic compound on the biofilm mode of growth. The spatial organization that occurs in a monoculture of bacteria has been investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) compiled with Energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy (EDS) technique for elemental composition and analysis. Hence, the optimal growth conditions for biofilm formation as chemical composition, pH, salinity, essential elemental nutrient dependence, as the presence of iron have been investigated.<br/>

The present study aims to understand the functioning of bacteria biofilm formation and to visualize the microorganisms for facilitating the better morphology, structure and matrix of the system. These results can lead to further research on the influence of surface attachment and bacterial biofilm.<br/>
