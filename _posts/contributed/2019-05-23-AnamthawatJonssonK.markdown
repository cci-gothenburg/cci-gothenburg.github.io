## Abstract

Lake Thingvallavatn is a rift valley lake in southwest Iceland, a crustal extension formed on a divergent boundary of the Eurasian and the North American tectonic plates. It is the largest natural lake in Iceland, with 84 km2 in surface area, average depth of 34 m, deepest 114 m, total volume of 2856 km3, and is still expanding as the plates keep moving apart at the rate of 2.5 cm per year. The lake is mostly fed by ground water. There is only one outflow, the river Sog, that runs for about 47 km into the ocean, and therefore the retention time of the reservoir is relatively high, making the lake water rather stratified. This, together with the complex topography of the lake bottom (volcanic origin, with cracks and faults), life in the lake evolves and diverges. Genetically different morphs of a salmonid fish have their own niches and diets, i.e. being limnetic or benthic. At the beginning of the food chain, there are phytoplanktons, the primary producers. Production and nutrient supply of phytoplanktons, especially diatoms, in Lake Thingvallavatn are known to vary greatly depending on locations, layers and seasons (Jónsson et al. 1992 Oikos 64). The photic layer of this lake extends from 20 to 40 m during summer and the temperature ranges from 0 to 13 C. In this lake, large diatom species, such as Aulacoseira islandica and A. subarctica, dominate the upper 10 m in the spring, April – May, with the density of more than one million cells per litre. They tend to disappear in the summer, falling to the lake bottom, but come back up during the autumn overturn. A. islandica is more of a winter-hardy diatom, thus keeping the photosynthetic production going throughout the year. Diatom diversity in this lake is not rich, i.e. very few species exist, but certain species have a very high density (Jónsson & Anamthawat-Jónsson 2019 Náttúrufr. 89). Other common diatom species include Asterionella, Nitzschia, Stephanodiscus and Urosolenia species. The primary production of North Atlantic Rift lakes, such as Lake Thingvallavatn, considerably exceeds that of natural lakes elsewhere at similar latitudes. <br/>
