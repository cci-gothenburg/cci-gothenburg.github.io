## Abstract

Heterogeneous nucleation of metal nanoparticles on amorphous substrate results in Winterbottom shapes of the metal nanoparticles. In an anisotropic system, for a given interfacial energy between the substrate and the particle, different orientation of nucleation would result in different Winterbottom shapes. The physical area of these Winterbottom shapes could be very different from each other, thus affecting the energetics of nucleation of each of these Winterbottom shapes. Herein lies the question of the most preferred orientation during heterogeneous nucleation on amorphous substrates. Analytical calculations of the Winterbottom shapes show that for a given particle-substrate combination, a certain orientation of the Winterbottom shape is preferred over other orientations and change of the interfacial energy between the particle and the substrate would result in other preferred orientation of the nucleated metal nanoparticle. <br/>

Experimentally, Au and Ag FCC metal nanoparticles were nucleated on oleylamine and butanedithiol functionalized amorphous carbon coating of the Cu mesh grid and the orientation of nucleation was studied using Precession Electron Diffraction technique. It was observed that Au nanoparticles nucleated on oleylamine functionalized carbon grid had preferred orientation for nucleation at around [111] and the preference had spread to some extent around [110] as well. Au nucleated on butanedithiol functionalized carbon grid had a much skewed nucleation preference at around [111] direction. Ag nucleated on oleylamine functionalized carbon grid had a skewed nucleation preference towards [110] direction. <br/>

Thus, it was proved both analytically and experimentally that there was a preference for nucleation orientation in case of these FCC metals on functionalized amorphous carbon support and this preference for a particular orientation could be tuned. Density functional theory studies were also conducted to investigate the implication of the orientation preference in heterogeneous gas phase catalysis.<br/>
