## Abstract

In the past 10 years, cell electron microscopy has lived 2 revolutions:.<br/>
* the rise of Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy (CLEM), largely represented by In-Resin fluorescence protocols, implying deep sample vitrification.<br/>
* the spectacular growth of volume Electron Microscopy (vEM) by bloc-face scanning-electron-microscopy technologies, requiring to turn the sample electro-conductive to function efficiently.<br/>

CryoCapCell has developed a series of tools that facilitate the use of both technologies and is now bridging them all through a complete workflow: from live cell imaging in the _CryoCapsule_[1,2] and high-pressure freezing with the HPM Live µ to electro-conductive sample embedding with the R221 resin[3].<br/>

These critical steps can be used independently or in combination to achieve full 3D-CLEM with data merging (eC-CLEM [4,5], opensource software developed by P. Paul-Gilloteaux and X. Heiligenstein).<br/>

We will introduce our technologies and their application range in the field of biology.<br/>
