## Abstract

Plastic particles and other anthropogenic particles collected in the environment are often first sorted manually dependent on their visual appearance and then transferred for polymer identification. The polymers are normally identified with spectroscopic techniques such as FTIR or Raman. This manual approach is labor intense and biased depending on the operator. We use a correlative system consisting of a confocal Raman with two lasers, 532 and 781 nm, a light microscope (LM) and a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) attachment. Raman can either be done inside the SEM or on a stand-alone platform. Whit this system, our aim is to achieve effective workflows with minimum operator bias. With a correlative sample holder, individual particle coordinates are identified and each particle can be measured with all techniques. For example, a prescreening of a filter is automatically done in the LM in order to identify particle coordinates and identify visual characteristics such as color and size. Then, the sample is transferred to Raman in the correlative sample holder and the Raman microscope is told to automatically acquire spectra from all particle coordinates identified in the LM. The same principle can be used between the LM and SEM where the particles can be imaged with high resolution together with identification of their elemental composition. For smaller particles, less than 10 um, the particles can be automatically imaged with particle coordinates in the SEM. These small particles can then be polymeric identified with the in-situ Raman system.<br/>
