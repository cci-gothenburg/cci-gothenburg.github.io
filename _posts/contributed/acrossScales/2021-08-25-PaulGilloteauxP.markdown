## Abstract

Accurate registration of imaging modalities is one of the key steps of a correlative imaging workflow.
EcClem (1) is a plugin under the free and open source software plateform ICY (2) aiming to ease the registration process in correlative microscopies workflows, whatever the modalities in use. We present here a new version of EcClem and EcClemAutofinder, which is considerably faster and offer new tools to construct your own workflows. 
In particular, a full workflow can be constructed by taking into account several intermediate imaging steps to ease the correlation, which can be cascaded and automatized as a visual protocol under ICY. We also provide a new method of error estimation in registration, allowing to assess the co-localization of pixels from different registered modalities (3). New functionalities for the visualization of correlation are also presented. 
This new version of the software has already been used in correlative workflows by collaborators (4–6)
