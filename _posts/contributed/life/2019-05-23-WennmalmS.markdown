## Abstract

Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy, FCS, is an established technique for analyzing biomolecular interactions and dynamics, in solution as well as in living cells. Two novel variants of FCS are presented which markedly enhance the ability of the technique in two situations. The first one, Inverse FCS, allows sizing of objects independently of their diffusion coefficient. This has advantages especially for protein clusters in membranes, where the diffusion coefficient is a poor indicator of size. The second one, FRET-FCS, allows the detection of rare FRET-active oligomers in solution. This allows detection of small oligomers of Amyloid Beta, even when present at less than one percent compared to non-interacting Abeta monomers.<br/>
