## Abstract

In the search for new functional shape memory alloys, ternary phases in the Cu-Pd-Sn system with compositions close to the full Heusler compound (A2BC) have been investigated. Only a limited number of reports on the ternary phases in the Cu-Pd-Sn system have previously been published. Compositions close to the Heusler composition Pd2CuSn have been reported as an orthorhombic phase (Pnma) [1] and to have a phase transition from orthorhombic to cubic [2].<br/>

The present study demonstrates that specimens in the same composition range show a reversible structural transformation around room temperature when investigated with polarized light microscopy (LM). The low-temperature phase shows a complex and interesting microstructure where the contrast features are consistent with twinning and a martensitic-like transformation. Electron backscatter diffraction in combination with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis show a fine twinned microstructure.<br/>

By use of high-resolution SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), twin formations over several length scales have been identified in the low temperature orthorhombic phase. It was found that the twin domains observed with LM (few µm wide) consist of twin domains around 80 nm wide that in turn exhibit even smaller twin domains (~10 nm wide).<br/>

Temperature dependent powder X-ray diffraction analysis confirms a structural transformation from the previously reported orthorhombic phase to a previously unreported high-temperature face-centered cubic phase (Fm3 ̅m). Simulated structures obtained by density functional theory calculations show good agreement with refined experimental data. By use of differential scanning calorimetry the phase transformation temperature was found to be 105°C upon heating and 58°C upon cooling.<br/>
