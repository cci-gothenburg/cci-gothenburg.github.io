## Abstract

Transmission Electron Microscopy can be used to observe growth of materials in situ, including III-V semiconductor nanowires by metal-organic chemical vapour deposition.  The ETEM (Environmental TEM) recently installed in Lund offers enhanced capabilities for such observations: high resolution images and compositional analysis in the microscope, multiple precursors and controlled flows in the gas handling system.  The core microscope is a Hitachi HF3300S ETEM with cold FEG and imaging aberration corrector.  The expanded polepiece gap accommodates specimen holders that may incorporate gas lines, a heating MEMS chip and a double tilt mechanism.  The holder is of the open type and up to 4 Pa of N2 may be injected into the specimen area, or up to 400 Pa if an “apertured lid” is fitted.  The gas handling system (GHS) is custom-built for 9 different gases, trimethylgallium, trimethylindium, trimethylaluminium, trimethylantimony, arsine, phosphine together with nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen; these last three will also allow more general ETEM studies. Other equipment includes a fast camera for real-time video recording, an X-ray detector for energy dispersive spectroscopy, and a secondary electron detector that proves especially useful for imaging surface facets in scanning TEM mode.  Residual gas analysers provide data on the presence of gas species. This presentation will give an overview of the instrument and of topics currently being studied, including interface dynamics during the growth of GaAs nanowires, InAs growth and tomography of complex nanowires.
