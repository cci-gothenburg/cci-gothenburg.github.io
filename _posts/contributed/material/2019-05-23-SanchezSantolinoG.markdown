## Abstract

The functional properties of materials and devices are critically determined by the presence of electric field structures inside them, especially at interface regions. Differential phase contrast (DPC) imaging in the electron microscope enables the study of such localized fields in materials. When electric fields are present inside the sample, the incident electron beam is deflected, producing a shift of the intensity on the detector plane proportional to the field strength. Advances in segmented and pixelated detectors combined with state of the art aberration correction technologies have enabled precise detection of these shifts and thus imaging electric fields in materials with atomic resolution [1]. Recent studies have shown it possible to directly visualize the atomic electric field, the field between the atomic nucleus and the surrounding electrons [2, 3]. Here we show a fully quantitative analysis of the atomic electric field for a crystalline GaN thin specimen. This allows us to obtain the internal atomic charge density distributions in real space, including both the positive nuclear and the negative screening electronic charges [4]. The experimental results, acquired using a second generation segmented annular all field detector composed of 16 segments and installed in a JEOL JEM-ARM300cF, will be discussed in comparison with full dynamical scattering simulations. This work constitutes a crucial step toward the determination of the local charge redistributions taking place in materials. <br/>
