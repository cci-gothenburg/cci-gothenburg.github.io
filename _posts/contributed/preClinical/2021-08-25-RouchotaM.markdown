## Abstract

Bone defects are one of the leading pathologies in the developing world and challenging to assess through non-invasive methods. The objective of the this study, is to create a preclinical platform, to non-invasively monitor bone defects and therapy efficiency, by exploiting complementary imaging techniques. Towards this scope, healthy mice were first imaged with the clinically approved tracer [99mTc]-MDP. Imaging was performed in three stages: (a) first with live, dynamic scintigraphy (γ-eyeTM, BIOEMTECH) to check and establish the best accumulation time points of the tracer and the main possible defect regions. Then, (b) high-resolution imaging was performed with CT imaging (X-CUBE, Molecubes) for the detailed anatomic illustration and (c) tomographic SPECT imaging (γ-CUBE, Molecubes) for the detailed metabolic function representation.

This platform was then exploited on a mouse calvarial defect model. Two symmetrical calvarial bone defects, 1.5 mm in diameter each, were created in female Swiss mice. Gaps were monitored weekly through SPECT/CT imaging, using [99mTc]-MDP for 5 weeks. Defects created on the left part of the mouse skull were left unfilled (control group), whereas those on the right part were filled with mineralized horse collagen scaffold materials (HA/Coll). For the HA/Coll treated defect, a peak in metabolic activity was noted at week 1 post-surgery and the defect was filled by newly developed bone tissue by week 3 post-surgery. In contrast, the metabolic activity at the control defect area was stable but significantly lower and a complete healing was not observed even up to week 5 post-surgery.

These results highlight the complementary information that can be exported through this platform: fast establishment of the best accumulation time and defect regions through live, dynamic scintigraphy, then high-resolution functional information on the metabolic activity that predicts bone formation, through SPECT imaging and high-resolution anatomic information that shows the actual bone being formed, through CT imaging.

The presented preclinical platform can serve as a strong non-invasive tool, to monitor bone defects and to evaluate both novel synthetic bone implants and therapy schemes aiming to increase bone metabolic activity and healing of a wide range of bone pathologies.
