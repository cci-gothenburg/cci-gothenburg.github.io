## Abstract

In correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM), automated correlation-based alignment is not directly possible due to the different contrast of EM and fluorescence images. Registration is thus often done by hand or semi-automatically using fiducial markers. We developed “DeepCLEM”, a fully automated CLEM registration workflow: a convolutional neural network predicts the fluorescent signal from the EM images, which is then automatically registered to the experimentally measured chromatin signal from the sample using correlation-based alignment. The complete workflow is available as a Fiji macro and, while targeted at array tomography, can be adapted for other imaging modalities as well as for 3D stacks.<br/>
