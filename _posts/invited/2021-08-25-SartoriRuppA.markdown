## Abstract

Cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM) approaches have emerged in the last two decades as very powerful methods to investigate the structure/function relationship of biological samples preserved as close as possible to the native state. With the advent of improved technology and dedicated commercial systems they have become more easily amenable to labs and simpler to be implemented. I will present cryo-CLEM methods and different tools with which they can be combined in order to address questions at the single cell level. In particular I will focus on a novel 3D cryo-CLEM pipeline that we are currently developing and optimizing at Institut Pasteur for the study of host-pathogen interactions and show some promising applications to collaborative projects within the Institute.<br/>
