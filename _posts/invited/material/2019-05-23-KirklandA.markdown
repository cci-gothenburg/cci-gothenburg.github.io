## Abstract

This lecture will describe firstly recent developments in the use of Scanning Transmission and Transmission Electron Microscopy applied to studies of dynamics in low dimensional materials.<br/>
I will describe recent work use high speed direct electron detectors with neural network processing to automatically map defect and adatom migrations within large data sets offering the possibility of directly measuring kinetic parameters on a local scale.<br/>
