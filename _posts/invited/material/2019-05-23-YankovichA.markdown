## Abstract

Enhancing our control over the interactions between light and matter at the smallest possible length scales will help us achieve next-generation photonics applications. In the strong coupling regime, the rate of coherent energy exchange between light and matter exceeds the systems decay rates, creating new hybridized states called polaritons. Polaritons exhibit inseparable light and matter properties that have led to several remarkable breakthroughs. Recently, plasmon-exciton polaritons (PEPs) have been realized using hybrid systems composed of localized surface plasmons (LSPs) in nanoparticles (NPs) and excitons in 2D transition metal dichalcogenide materials, extending polaritonic concepts to ultracompact footprints and room temperature operation. Optical scattering spectroscopy has allowed for significant understanding of PEPs, but imaging the sub-wavelength nature of PEPs is still an open challenge because of the optical diffraction-limited spatial resolution. STEM EELS has been important for studying the basic nature of uncoupled LSPs and excitons. However, even though STEM EELS has been recently theoretically predicted to be sensitive to PEPs, it has not yet been used to experimentally detect PEPs.<br/>

Here, we present a STEM EELS study on hybrid plasmon-exciton systems composed of Ag NPs and few-layer WS2. The Ag NPs have a triangular shape, single crystalline structure, 40-110 nm side lengths, clear faceted surfaces, and sharp 5-10 nm radius corners. Correlative optical DF and EELS experiments reveal that the uncoupled NPs host strong dipolar LSPs and the uncoupled WS2 flakes host A-, B-, and C- excitons. To create the hybrid system, the Ag NP size is chosen so that the dipolar LSP spectrally overlaps with the WS2 A-exciton, enabling hybridization. The experimental EELS observations of the uncoupled and coupled systems are in good agreement with simulations, which are calculated using the MNPBEM toolbox. The EELS simulations of coupled systems are used to predict at what WS2 thickness and EELS energy resolution the PEP mode splitting is resolvable. This presentation will highlight our PEP results that correlate experimental EELS, optical DF, and morphological analysis, as well as numerical optical and EELS calculations. These findings open up the possibility for in-depth studies of plasmon-exciton interactions with unprecedented spatial resolution. [arXiv:1905.04067]<br/>
