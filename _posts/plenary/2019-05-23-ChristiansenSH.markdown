## Abstract
Complex, three dimensional (3D) nano-architectures of various material combinations with micro and nano-scale precision will be presented.<br/>

Examples range from bone tissue with various disease signatures over additive manufactured ceramics composites for energy applications to semiconductor nanowire ensembles which serve as light emitters or absorbers in respective integrated device concepts.<br/>

In this context, the understanding and in case of engineering materials its optimization will rely on advanced electron-, ion- and x-ray microscopy in correlation to various analytics and spectroscopic techniques such as energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS), Raman spectroscopy, cathode- and photo-luminescence, mechanical testing based on indentation and compression testing and electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD).<br/>
