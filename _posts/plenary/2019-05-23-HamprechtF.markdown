## Abstract

Semantic segmentation (which pixel belongs to which class?) is starting to be a solved problem, at least when sufficient training data is available. Instance segmentation (which pixels belong to which object instance, when there are multiple similar objects?) is still a challenge.<br/>

Given the great success of neural networks in semantic segmentation, it is natural to try and use them for instance segmentation as well. Unfortunately, the final grouping step in such a pipeline is often not differentiable, preventing an end-to-end learning. In this talk, I will discuss recent work to overcome this obstacle and hopefully achieve better instance segmentation.<br/>
