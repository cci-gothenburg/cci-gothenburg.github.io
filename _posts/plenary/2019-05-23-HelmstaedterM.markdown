## Abstract

The mapping of neuronal connectivity is one of the main challenges in neuroscience. Only with the knowledge of wiring diagrams is it possible to understand the computational capacities of neuronal networks, both in the sensory periphery, and especially in the mammalian cerebral cortex. Our methods for dense circuit mapping are based on 3-dimensional electron microscopy (EM) imaging of tissue, which allows imaging nerve tissue at nanometer-scale resolution across substantial volumes, extending to more than one millimetre on the side. The most time-consuming aspect of circuit mapping, however, is image analysis; human contributions to analysis time far exceeds the time needed to acquire the data. Therefore, we are developing methods to make circuit reconstruction feasible by increasing analysis speed and accuracy, using a combination of human-machine interaction and artificial intelligence. We have are applying these methods to neuronal circuits in the mammalian cerebral cortex. We are currently mapping the local circuit structure of different cortices in various species. <br/>
