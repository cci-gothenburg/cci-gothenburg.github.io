## Abstract

Elementary electromagnetic sources with well-defined near- and far-field properties form the fundamentals to systematically describe and understand observed electromagnetic phenomena of nanometre-sized objects, as well as their interactions and potential applications. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy (CL) can access these optical properties at nanometre spatial resolution, where the contrasting juxtaposition of EELS and CL information on the identical object helps to discern radiative from non-radiative optical modes [1].<br/>

This presentation will exemplify the applications of both EELS and CL for enhancing the perception in nano-optics by showing two case studies, namely the far-field radiation of three-dimensional plasmonic gold taper and of dynamic toroidal moments. The studies on the gold tapers revealed that the excited surface plasmons either are guided away from the apex along the taper or couple to the far-field radiation depending on the tapers’ opening angle [2,3]. The radiative nature of dynamic toroidal dipole modes supported in oligomer nanocavities in thin silver films has been addressed to distinguish them from static toroidal dipoles and plasmonic dark modes [4-6]. Moreover, numerical finite-difference time-domain simulations were performed for comprehensive understanding and strengthening the conclusions [7].<br/>
