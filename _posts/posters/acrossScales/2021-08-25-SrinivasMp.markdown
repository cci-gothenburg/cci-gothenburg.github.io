## Abstract

We have developed a nanoparticle-based imaging platform1 that allows imaging using 19F MRI2, PET (in submission), SPECT3, ultrasound4, photoacoustics5, fluorescence, and EM (unpublished). We are working on these nanoparticles to label and image therapeutic cells, such as dendritic cells or engineered T cells in vivo, in a longitudinal and quantitative manner. This information is vital to the optimisation of cell therapy in oncology and regenerative medicine.

The nanoparticles consist of a polymer-entrapped perfluorocarbon of about 200 nm in diameter. Here, I will discuss what we have learned about the internal structure of the nanoparticles, where the super-hydrophobic perfluorocarbon appears hydrated, and how this unusual structure impacts its biological properties. Importantly, the unusual multi-core structure of the nanoparticles has biological impact; we found that the 200 nm particles break down into smaller domains where the perfluorocarbon remains stabilized and results in 15x faster clearance in vivo, compared to core-shell particles6.

The nanoparticles are approved for a clinical trial tracking therapeutic dendritic cells in the Netherlands. We are also working on upscaling technology7 at GMP grade.
