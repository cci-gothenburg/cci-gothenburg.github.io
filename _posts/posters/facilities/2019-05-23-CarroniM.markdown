## Abstract

With the explosion of cryo-EM to get high-to-medium resolution structures of proteins and protein complexes, request for data collected on high-end microscopes is rising. The costs of the equipment as well as the need for expertise on both microscope operation and image processing, is pushing institutions to gather forces for the creation of national centres for cryo-EM. In Sweden, funding from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg, Family Erling Persson, and Kempe Foundations, SciLifeLab, Stockholm University and Ume√• University allowed the creation of the Cryo-EM Swedish National Facility, which provides the scientific community with state-of-the-art equipment and expertise in single particle cryo-EM and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). The poster shows the building of the Facility, the equipment available and the way projects are handled in both screening and data acquisition. Finally, results obtained in these two and a half years of operation and future development plans are also highlighted.<br/>
