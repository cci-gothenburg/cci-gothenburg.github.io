## Abstract

IVMSU is a node of the NMI, a Swedish infrastructure for the use and support of advanced microscopy in life science. IVMSU is an open access facility and is equipped for a broad range of intravital microscopy (IVM) applications that require both multi- and single-photon excitation. The setup available at IVMSU is suitable for in vivo and in vitro studies of model organisms, organs, tissue and cells. Two multiphoton laser lines (1045nm and 680-1300nm) enable deep tissue penetration and in also label-free detection methods such as second/third harmonic generation and autofluorescence. In addition, the LEICA SP8 FALCON function allows fluorescence life-time measurements (FLIM). FLIM-FRET is used to investigate molecular interactions.  And since FLIM-FRET is internally calibrated, many of the disadvantages of intensity-based FRET measurements can be overcome.<br/>

This equipment enables imaging of dynamic biological processes at cellular and subcellular levels. The great advantages of IVM compared to classical methods are that imaging occurs in the native cellular/organ environment, preparation artifacts can be excluded and self-controlled longitudinal studies can be performed, which is increasing data quality and validity tremendously.<br/>

As an open-access facility, open for external users, IVMSU can be considered exceptional also in a European perspective.<br/>
