## Abstract

For long time, imaging of a specific protein within a cell was reserved for fluorescence microscopy. In transmission electron microscopy (TEM), visualizing proteins has traditionally been done with immunogold-labelling, where the size of the antibody-gold-particle complexes is approximately 28 nm, resulting in low spatial precision. One way to visualize proteins for TEM with high spatial resolution, less than 10 nm, is to genetically fuse a nanobody with the ascorbate peroxidase 2 (APEX2) targeting the protein of interest via a green fluorescent protein (GFP) label, following by cell fixation and treatment  with 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) (de Beer, 2018). DAB forms an insoluble polymer after oxidation by the peroxidase APEX2 when treated with H2O2. We are using a similar approach for correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) of protein migration studies of ArfGAP1.<br/>

The ArfGAP1 is a cytosolic protein commonly localized close to the Golgi membrane, but it is also found around lipid droplets (LDs) after oleic acid (OA) treatment (Gannon, 2014). The aim of our work is to specifically localize ArfGAP1 in Hek293 cells as a function of OA treatment with the addition of an anti-GFP nanobody tagged with APEX2 and mCherry by CLEM.<br/>

We used T-Rex inducible HEK293 cells which overexpress ArfGAP1-GFP after induction. Simultaneously, we transiently transfected these cells to overexpress an anti-GFP nanobody (nb)-APEX2-mCherry construct. The approach of targeting GFP directly makes the specificity of fluorescent labelling possible at EM level, via the electron dense precipitate produced at the locus of the construct. Using this method, we were successfully able to image ArfGAP1 both around the Golgi and around the LDs by TEM, resolving its ultrastructure. We confirmed this approach by CLEM. Although the method is technically challenging, we managed to optimize the setup to label two additional cytosolic proteins of interest, with successful results.<br/>

In conclusion, due to the small size of the GFP-nb-APEX2-mCherry complex and the DAB reaction product, this in situ method for specific protein labelling in TEM takes full advantage of the resolving power of the TEM. Potentially, any soluble GFP-tagged proteins of interest (POI) could be visualized in TEM with this method.<br/>
