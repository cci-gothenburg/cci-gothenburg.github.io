## Abstract

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) is routinely used for the characterization of nano-sized particles in life sciences. Among the variety of specimen analyzed, some involve risks and require strict safety procedures when being handled. Working with infectious and pathogenic agents such as some viruses, vaccines or gene therapy vectors for example, implies to operate in contained facilities with a well-controlled environment.<br/>

Some of the requirements for working in Biosafety Level 2 (BSL2) conditions, as described by the European Commission guidelines, are quite challenging to fulfill within the standard TEM workflow. Consequently, the daily routines need to be adapted in order to combine the challenges of TEM with safety requirements, such as preparing the  specimen and transferring liquid nitrogen inside a facility with a high air-flow, or decontaminating the equipment used for the specimen preparation with corrosive agents. To ensure that the equipment is not damaged, and the safety of the operator is guaranteed, along with reliability of the results, established standard protocols need to be implemented and validated, together with controlled access only to personnel that has specific and documented training for preparing and imaging TEM specimens in such conditions.<br/>

Construction and establishment of such a BSL2 TEM facility including a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliant TEM workflow, proves to be tremendously relevant, especially for e.g., the vaccine and gene therapy domains. In these fields new requirements from the authorities place stress on investigating the impact of changes on the product during process and product development. New demands in product characterization involve morphological description of the particles present in the formulations, typically nanoparticles like viruses, virus-like particles and adjuvants in the range of 0.01 - 0.1 µm. TEM offers the means to answer these questions in a direct way. Therefore, being able to prepare and image specimens while respecting the safety guidelines also for BSL2 specimen is a clear need.<br/>

The challenges and hurdles that were overcome to implement a GMP workflow in a BSL2 lab for the analysis of biological specimen with TEM will be presented and discussed, illustrated with case studies demonstrating its analytical capacities and application domains.<br/>
