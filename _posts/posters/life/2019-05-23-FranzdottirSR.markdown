## Abstract
Intracellular localization and dynamics of proteins can provide important clues about their function and help resolve individual roles of multi-tasking proteins. Recent advances in gene editing techniques and fluorescent microscopy have made the imaging of protein dynamics and interactions in whole organisms or isolated organs an attractive approach to complement other functional methods.<br/>

The AAA+ ATPases Pontin and Reptin are highly conserved in Eukaryotes and have been associated with various cellular processes through multiple protein complexes, although their roles in each case have not been fully explained. We are exploring the cytoplasmic roles of Pontin and Reptin in multicellular and developmental context, with emphasis on the Drosophila melanogaster nervous system. As part of these studies, we have generated a toolkit for the study of the two proteins in vivo, by knocking in fluorescent tags on the endogenous proteins in flies using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. The aim of the project presented here was to map the protein expression of Pontin and Reptin at high spatiotemporal resolution throughout fly development using both conventional confocal LSM and live light-sheet microscopy. We have confirmed that despite high level of co-expression and nuclear localization, Pontin and Reptin show partially non-overlapping expression and are not confined to the nucleus. Pontin distribution in the nervous system is of particular interest. Further studies will be performed at higher resolution in selected cell types to determine intracellular dynamics as well as interactions between the two proteins and with other proteins or organelles.<br/>
