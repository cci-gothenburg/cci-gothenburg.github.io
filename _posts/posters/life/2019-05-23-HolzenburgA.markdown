## Abstract

Quantum phenomena are intrinsic to many phenomena in living systems such as birds and butterflies detecting the Earth's magnetic field, olfactory reception, ion channel-based concerted firing of action potentials culminating in conscious thoughts, quantum-tunneled electron travel in the respiratory chain, or the highly efficient quantum coherence-enabled energy-transfer processes employed by photosynthetic organisms [1]. With regards to the latter, checking the truth of the underlying principles is challenging as the experimental measurements employed may perturb a quantum system into a classical one [2,3]. Here we report the uncovering of the foundations of photosynthetic energy using an approach that extends experimental data into those realms where the use of a non-perturbing approach is critically required.<br/>

TD-DFT (CAM-B3LYP) was used to calculate the UV-Vis spectra for three Chl dimers: P680 Chla/Chla (D1/D2), 606/607 Chlb/Chlb (LHCII), and 605/606 (LHCII). The ωB97X-D results showed strong communication between the Chla/Chla (P680) pair (Mg-Mg distance 8.15 Å) that is parallel to each other with respect to the porphyrin rings, as illustrated by a strong red-shift observed in the spectra of the dimer versus the monomers. The 606/607 Chlb/Chlb pair in LHCII (Mg-Mg distance 9.33 Å) does not have the same level of communication as the P680 special pair. In contrast, the Chlb/Chlb pair at a Mg-Mg distance of 12.52 Å (605/606) showed weak communication (no red-shift). Red-shifts were only observed in clusters that contained two Chl’s with a Mg-Mg distance of ≤9.3 Å and in a parallel orientation pointing at the angular dependence on the level of communication.  Real-Time TD-DFT calculations were performed to investigate the transfer rate between pairs of chromophores in LHCII.   Preliminary results are consistent with red-shifts observed in the UV-Vis calculations and an order of magnitude faster than previously reported.<br/>

While we have so far analyzed energy communication patters within LHCII and the reaction center, the other major subunits of the PSII have still to be interrogated.<br/>
