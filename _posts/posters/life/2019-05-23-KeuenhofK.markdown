## Abstract

The presence of established mechanisms to cope with stressors such as environmental changes, starvation or anoxia is essential for survival of all species on earth. To elucidate these stress response mechanisms at the cellular level the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an organism commonly studied. Using genetics and molecular biology, many heat-shock responses have been mapped out. However, there is no comprehensive and quantitative model for structural changes within the cell after heat-shock.<br/>

Using transmission electron microscopy of high-pressure frozen yeast cells, we have imaged thousands of cells during different stages of heat-shock. So far, we have quantified the size, number and location of most organelles and some of their contact sites during this heat-shock timeline. We have observed an increase in the volume of cells, mitochondria, vacuoles, lipid droplets, and an enlargement of contact sites in heat-shocked cells.
An unbiased classification and quantification of structural cellular changes creates new maps of the internal organization of the cell during cellular stress. Unexpected changes in morphology and sizes of organelles can now be further investigated using molecular cell biology and genetics to unravel new cellular stress response mechanisms or bring new light to already described pathways.<br/>
