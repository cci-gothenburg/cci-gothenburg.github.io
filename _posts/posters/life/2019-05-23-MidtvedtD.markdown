## Abstract

Cells adapt their biophysical properties in response to changes in their local environment. However, quantifying these changes at the single-cell level has only recently become possible, largely relying on fluorescent labeling strategies. In our work, we have utilized a digital holographic microscope (DHM) to demonstrate label-free spatio-temporal monitoring and quantification of stress-induced changes to the intracellular environment of individual yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). As an example, during an osmotic stress, yeast cells respond by water outflux in combination with production of various sugars, primarily glycerol, to counter an increased osmolarity. Our DHM setup enabled us to succesfully isolate the temporal response of cellular water flux from the rate of production of higher molecular weight compounds, in addition to identifying the produced compounds in terms of the product of their refractive index increment (dn/dc) and molar mass[1]. The ability to identify, quantify and temporally resolve multiple biophysical processes in living cells at the single cell level offers a crucial complement to label-based strategies, suggesting broad applicability in studies of a wide-range of cellular processes, some of which will be discussed in this presentation.<br/>
