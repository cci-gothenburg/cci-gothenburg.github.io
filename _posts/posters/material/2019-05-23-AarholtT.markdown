## Abstract

We demonstrate the viability of the Voronoi-cell integration method for fast and accurate measurement of atomic-column intensity on HR-STEM images. We then use this technique to analyse the effect of (HSE) DFT-relaxation on the simulated STEM contrast of the InZn and VZn defect complex pair in ZnO. We show that a very high number of frozen phonon configurations is necessary for the thin sample. By use of Michelson Contrast, we present a novel method of calculating the optimal acceptance angles to maximise the chance of detecting the defect in an experimental setting. Finally, we show the significant impact of cooling the sample to liquid nitrogen temperatures on the simulated STEM contrast.<br/>
