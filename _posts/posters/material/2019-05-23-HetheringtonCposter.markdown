## Abstract

A recent photo electron spectroscopy (PES) study on tin-oxide nanoparticles has measured a chemical shift two times larger for Sn(IV) oxide than the value that had been generally accepted.  The technique used in the study involves forming a beam of particles in vacuum, then performing the PES on the particles while they are still travelling in vacuum.  The key aspect of this technique is that the measurements are performed before the particles are disturbed by impacting a substrate or encountering the atmosphere. Both SnO and SnO2 nanoparticles were formed and characterized by PES. PES was also performed on the deposited material and it showed that the SnO2 chemical composition survived the deposition. Some changes in composition for the particles exposed to air were detected however, suggesting an intermediate oxide was formed, probably at the surface. TEM studies were later performed on deposited material and confirmed the nanoparticles survived the deposition retaining their separation and crystalline structure. The diffraction patterns of the SnO2 particles gave lattice constants close to the macroscopic Sn(IV)-oxide.   The diffraction pattern for the sample composed of material formed by deposition of SnO/Sn particles is more difficult to interpret and the reasons behind this will be discussed.  The work has been supported by the Swedish Research Council (VR), the Göran Gustafsson Foundation, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, the Crafoord Foundation, Nordforsk, and the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research, under its Research Infrastructure Fellow programme. We would also like to thank the MAX-lab and MAX-IV staff for their assistance.<br/>
