## Abstract

Nowadays, functionalization of various materials is a rapidly growing research topic. In this study, to avoid harmful liquid waste products, an aerosol process was used to functionalize fibrous cellulose. The fibers were functionalized with antibacterial silver and photocatalytically active titanium dioxide nanoparticles. The functionalization process was based on a fluidized bed reactor where the fibers were fluidized with an air flow. An additional nanoparticle aerosol was generated using liquid flame spray and a fraction of its output flow was introduced into the fluidized bed, where the nanoparticles attached onto the surface of the suspended fibers. After the functionalization, the fibers with nanoparticles were characterized with a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Zeiss Ultraplus) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS, Oxford Instruments XMaxN) and with a (scanning) transmission electron microscope ((S)TEM, Jeol F200) together with EDS (Jeol Dual EDS). With FESEM, it was difficult to observe nanoparticles on the functionalized fibers and thus, mainly (S)TEM  characterization was used. With STEM-EDS analyses, the nanoparticles were identified and by (S)TEM imaging, their distribution on the fibers was studied. For imaging, various (S)TEM detectors were utilized: BF TEM, BF and DF STEM, and BSE (topo and compo) and SE. (S)TEM was the key technique to verify the successful collection of nanoparticles on the fibers. Both the silver and titanium dioxide nanoparticles seemed to form a fairly uniform spatial distribution without significant agglomeration. The observed surface number density of the nanoparticles on the fiber was in line with the parallel estimates on the amount of silver and titanium dioxide on fiber material. Thus, the novel aerosol process introduced has a potential in promoting antibacterial and photocatalytically active cellulose fiber materials.<br/>
