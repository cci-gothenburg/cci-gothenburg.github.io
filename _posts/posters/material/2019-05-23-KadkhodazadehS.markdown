## Abstract

Nanoscale characterisation of the oxidation process in Cu nanoparticles (NPs) is of interest in a number of fields including catalysis, microelectronics, photovoltaics and plasmonics. Among other techniques, this process has been studied with optical spectroscopy[1–3], due to the strong dependence of the localised surface plasmon (LSPR) of Cu NPs on oxidation. However, given the substantial morphological and chemical changes that occur as the result of oxidation, a detailed understanding of the correlation between the recorded LSPRs and the nanoscale structure and chemistry of the Cu NPs is necessary. Here, we have employed scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in an environmental TEM (ETEM) to monitor the morphology, chemistry and the LSPRs of ~ 50 nm diameter Cu NPs in an O2 environment in real time. The dynamics of metal to oxide conversion, which hereupon is accompanied by the formation and growth of voids in the NPs (Kirkendall effect), are monitored with sub-nanometre spatial resolution. The recorded EEL signal reveals a continuous redshift of the LSPRs of the NPs throughout the oxidation process. This is accompanied by an initial increase in intensity, which is then followed by intensity drop, broadening and splitting of the LSPR signal upon void formation, and eventually complete loss of signal at the later stages of oxidation.<br/>
