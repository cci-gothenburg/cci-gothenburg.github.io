## Abstract

Semiconducting nanowires are thin rod structures which have promising applications in different fields, due to, e.g. the possibility to combine different epitaxially grown materials and crystal structures not combinable in bulk, making fine-tuning of bandgaps possible. While most such structures can be analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) projection images, some features, such as rotational symmetry/asymmetry, can get lost. Electron tomography (ET) is a useful method for retrieving the 3D structure, which can both correlate growth parameters to actual morphology as well as explain measured properties. With increased complexity in the component design ET will be important for high-resolving 3D analysis.<br/>

Here we present electron tomographic studies of nanowire structures from two different material systems: Au-seeded and Sn-doped GaAs wires, and Au-seeded InAs-AlSb-InAs core-shell-shell wires. The GaAs-wires are grown using Aerotaxy while the core-shell-shell structure is grown using conventional metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE). Both sets of wires were reconstructed using ET using reconstruction algorithms: simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT), discrete algebraic reconstruction technique (DART) and compressed sensing ET (CS-ET), from tilt-series (±75°) images (JEM-2200FS TEM, high-angle annular dark-field, HAADF detector). The reconstructions were calculated using the ASTRA toolbox for Matlab and Python.<br/>

The GaAs wires show two interesting features: The surface is covered by droplets/particles that are of Ga (in comparison to the GaAs in the wire) and the seed particle containing Ga, Au and Sn have segregated into regions with different composition, separable in the reconstruction. Actual surface arrangement of the particles as well as volume measurements and composition of the segregated seed particle are presented. For the InAs-AlSb-InAs wire the cross-section is shown and conclusions can be drawn regarding the differences in faceting between the two materials. Also, the layer thickness as a function of the position along the wire and around the circumference (azimuthal angle) can clearly be visualized.<br/>

In conclusion, ET shows in these studies its importance for nanowire analysis in which both surface features and internal morphology can be analyzed and quantified. Especially rotational symmetries/asymmetries, that can be difficult to deduct from single projections, are more easily analyzed.<br/>
