## Abstract

The environmental transmission electron microscope (ETEM) provides a unique opportunity to study crystal growth in-situ. Over the last few years, it has allowed researchers to go beyond the ex-situ observations and enabled studies of the growth of crystalline III-V semiconductor nanowires in real time. Here we expand the knowledge of Au-seeded InAs nanowires further by discussing observations made of the Au particle behavior, with emphasis on the state and composition before and after nucleation.<br/>

The InAs nanowires are grown within a B-COR aberration image-corrected Hitachi HF3300S ETEM, which is connected to a metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) system. The MOVPE supplies trimethylindium and arsine as growth precursors into the microscope, where the nanowires grow from Au particles. By studying the growth in-situ, the layer-by-layer growth and the resulting crystal structure can be followed in real time. The experiments are typically carried out at growth temperatures used in regular MOVPE (380-480°C), and x-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) is used for compositional analysis of the particles.<br/>

Preliminary results of the In build-up in the Au particles will be shown. By recording real time XEDS spectra of a particle during supply of In precursor, the compositional build-up of material can be followed. This is done at different temperatures to show how it correlates to available Au-In phase diagrams. By doing this, predictions can be made about when phase changes will occur and at what composition the particle will be saturated. When arsine is provided, the growth of InAs nanowires is initiated and the particle and wire compositions can be recorded in real time during growth via XEDS. We also plan on presenting correlations between the uptake of material and the state of the particle at different temperatures, both before and during growth. We have for example observed a transformation from a liquid hemispherical to a solid faceted particle, related to the formation of a AuIn2 phase, as the flow of In precursors was increased during nanowire growth. This rapidly changed the conditions of the growth, and would be impossible to observe outside of the ETEM.<br/>
