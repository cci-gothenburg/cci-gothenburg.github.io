## Abstract

By conventional transmission electron microscopy techniques, studying precipitates in heavily pre-deformed heat-treatable Al alloys is challenging due to the contrast from dislocations masking out the precipitates. It is however of great interest to study precipitates in such samples, due to their importance for the macroscopical properties and the widespread use of work hardened materials. In this work, the effect of natural aging prior to- and followed by deformation is investigated.  High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was used to identify which precipitate structures were present in the sample. This revealed that particular phases were formed at dislocations and others were dominant in the areas free of dislocations. Acquiring reliable statistics about the precipitate distribution using atomic resolution HAADF-STEM however is time consuming and expensive, thus a different technique was needed for this purpose. Scanning precession electron diffraction (SPED) has recently emerged as a promising technique in visualizing the precipitate distribution in non-deformed Al alloys and in this work, its applicability on pre-deformed samples is determined. By the means of this technique, virtual dark-field images is formed using the 4D dataset comprised of a 2D PED pattern in each pixel of a 2D scan area. The disturbing contrast from the dislocations seen in the corresponding bright-field images was not present in the virtual dark field images. By preprocessing and utilizing non-negative matrix factorization, a reconstructed and simplified decomposition of the dataset was obtained. The phases in the microstructure were mapped by comparing the SPED data decomposition results with the fast Fourier transforms of the HAADF-STEM images of the identified phases in the samples. Subsequently, the phase mapping results were compared to the positions of the dislocation network. This revealed differences in the phase distributions when deforming prior to or after natural aging, which will be shown. It is concluded that the combination of atomic resolution HAADF-STEM and SPED allows for a detailed characterization of precipitates in heavily deformed Al samples.<br/>
