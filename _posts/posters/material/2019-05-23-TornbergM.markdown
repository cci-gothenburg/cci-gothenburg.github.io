## Abstract

Crystal growth of III-V semiconductor nanowires assisted by a liquid particle requires, apart from successful nucleation, 
that the particle continuously wet the top of the nanowire. Recent TEM observations have shown that with increasing droplet 
volume, it may form a truncation of the interface between the nanowire and the liquid[1,2], and eventually get displaced from 
the top facet[3,4]. While this has been observed and discussed from the nucleation point of view, it has not been addressed 
from the droplet dynamics point of view as carefully.<br/>

Here we compare in-situ TEM observations of the droplet-nanowire interface during growth of Au-assisted GaAs nanowires, 
with calculations of the stability of the droplet on the nanowire top facet by balancing the capillary forces. Theoretically, 
we expand the Young’s relation for droplet on a surface to include a truncated facet and use it to give boundaries for the 
solid-vapor and liquid-vapor surface energy ratio with respect to the contact angle of the droplet. These calculations 
predict that formation of a truncation of the solid-liquid interface increases the stability for having a droplet on 
the top of a nanowire. From the experimental observations, based on real-time imaging at 20 frames/s, we are able to 
estimate the surface tension and contact angle of the droplet. By comparing the extracted values to our theoretical predictions, 
we are able to fit the surface energy of the solid–vapor interface for the wurtzite GaAs {10-10} sidefacet. 
We get an experimental prediction of the surface energy for the growth conditions (pressures and temperatures) 
in comparison to the previously existing theoretical predictions made for ideal environments and reconstructions.<br/> 

To conclude, using high framerate imaging in conjunction with theoretical estimations we will present a reasoning 
for the formation of a truncation at the droplet-nanowire interface. In addition, we will show the observed droplet 
dynamics and how it is used to estimate the surface energy of wurtzite GaAs.<br/>
